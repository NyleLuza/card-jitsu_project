## Why this Project?
All four of us were interested in game development and we came to the consensus of recreating the iconic game "Card-Jitsu." We are looking to create our own twist on the classic Club Penguin strategy card game with the use of the Roblox Studio environment. Our goal is to create a fully functional game to publish to the Roblox game catalog.
